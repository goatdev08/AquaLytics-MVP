# Task ID: 13
# Title: Create Manual Metrics Entry Form
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the comprehensive form for manual metric entry with real-time validation
# Details:
Create components/forms/MetricsForm.tsx with React Hook Form implementing the complete MetricFormSchema. Include sections for: basic info (swimmer, competition, date, distance, stroke, phase), first segment metrics (T15_1, BRZ_1, T25_1, F1), second segment metrics (T15_2, BRZ_2, T25_2, F2), global metrics (T_TOTAL, BRZ_TOTAL). Implement real-time validation feedback, consistency checking (T25 > T15, T_TOTAL â‰¥ segments), and automatic calculation preview. Add form state persistence and submission with loading states.

# Test Strategy:
Test all validation rules trigger correctly, verify consistency checks work in real-time, validate form submission handles errors gracefully, and ensure form state persists during navigation.
