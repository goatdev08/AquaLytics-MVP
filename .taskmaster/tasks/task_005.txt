# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build Base UI Components Library
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create reusable UI components following Phoenix theme and design system
# Details:
Create components/ui/ directory with base components: Button.tsx (with Phoenix gradient variants, hover effects, loading states), Input.tsx (with validation states, Phoenix focus colors), Select.tsx (custom dropdown with Phoenix styling), Card.tsx (with Phoenix subtle gradients, hover lift effects), Modal.tsx (with backdrop blur, Phoenix accents), LoadingSpinner.tsx (with Phoenix gradient animation). Each component should support light/dark mode, be fully typed with TypeScript, and include proper accessibility attributes. Use clsx and tailwind-merge for conditional styling.

# Test Strategy:
Test each component in isolation with Storybook-like approach, verify accessibility with screen readers, validate responsive behavior, and ensure Phoenix theme consistency across all variants.
