# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Data Filtering System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive filtering system for metrics analysis
# Details:
Build components/data/DataFilters.tsx with filter controls for: temporal filters (date range picker), context filters (swimmer multi-select, competition select, distance select, stroke select, phase select), metric filters (parameter selection, manual/automatic toggle), performance filters (time range slider, velocity range slider). Create lib/hooks/useFilters.ts for filter state management and URL synchronization. Implement filter persistence and reset functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Test all filter combinations work correctly, verify URL synchronization maintains filter state on page refresh, validate filter persistence across sessions, and ensure filter reset clears all selections.
