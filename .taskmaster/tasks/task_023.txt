# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize application performance for fast loading and smooth interactions
# Details:
Implement Next.js performance optimizations: dynamic imports for heavy components, image optimization for assets, font optimization with next/font. Add React optimizations: memo for expensive components, useMemo for calculations, useCallback for event handlers. Implement caching strategies: Zustand persistence, API response caching, chart data memoization. Configure bundle analysis and code splitting for optimal loading. Add loading skeletons and progressive enhancement.

# Test Strategy:
Measure and verify initial load time < 2 seconds, validate bundle size < 500KB (excluding Chart.js), test smooth interactions on low-end devices, and ensure caching reduces redundant API calls.
