# Task ID: 20
# Title: Build Analytics and Visualization Pages
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 17, 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive analytics interface with charts and comparisons
# Details:
Build app/analytics/page.tsx as main analytics dashboard with filterable charts and metrics overview. Create app/analytics/swimmer/[id]/page.tsx for individual swimmer profiles with detailed progression charts and personal records. Build app/analytics/compare/page.tsx for multi-swimmer comparison with radar charts and side-by-side metrics. Create app/analytics/rankings/page.tsx with sortable rankings by stroke, distance, and time period.

# Test Strategy:
Test all analytics pages load correctly with real data, verify individual swimmer profiles show accurate information, validate comparison functionality works with multiple swimmers, and ensure rankings are sortable and filterable.
