# Task ID: 15
# Title: Build Automatic Metrics Calculation Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core calculation engine for the 6 automatic swimming metrics
# Details:
Complete the SwimmingMetricsCalculator class in api/calculations/swimming_metrics.py with methods: calculate_segment_velocity (V1, V2 = 25/T25), calculate_average_velocity (V_promedio = 50/T_TOTAL), calculate_distance_per_stroke (DIST x BRZ = 50/BRZ_TOTAL), calculate_distance_without_underwater (DIST sin F = 50 - (F1 + F2)), calculate_average_underwater (F promedio = (F1 + F2)/2). Integrate calculation engine with data ingestion pipeline to automatically compute and store calculated metrics when manual metrics are submitted.

# Test Strategy:
Test each calculation formula with known inputs and expected outputs, verify calculations are triggered automatically on data ingestion, validate calculated metrics are stored correctly in database, and ensure error handling for edge cases (division by zero, negative values).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement SwimmingMetricsCalculator Class [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the SwimmingMetricsCalculator class in api/calculations/swimming_metrics.py with methods to calculate the six automatic swimming metrics.
### Details:
Create methods for calculate_segment_velocity, calculate_average_velocity, calculate_distance_per_stroke, calculate_distance_without_underwater, and calculate_average_underwater as specified.

## 2. Integrate Calculation Engine with Data Ingestion Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Connect the SwimmingMetricsCalculator with the data ingestion pipeline to automatically compute and store metrics upon manual metric submission.
### Details:
Modify the data ingestion pipeline to invoke the calculation engine when new manual metrics are submitted, ensuring calculated metrics are stored appropriately.

## 3. Implement Data Validation and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Add validation checks and error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity during metric calculations and ingestion.
### Details:
Implement checks for data completeness, type correctness, and handle exceptions gracefully to prevent pipeline failures.

## 4. Optimize Performance of Calculation Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Enhance the performance of the SwimmingMetricsCalculator to handle large datasets efficiently.
### Details:
Refactor code to improve computational efficiency, possibly by implementing vectorized operations or parallel processing where applicable.

## 5. Develop Monitoring and Logging Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Set up monitoring and logging for the calculation engine and data ingestion pipeline to track performance and identify issues.
### Details:
Implement logging of key events and metrics, and establish monitoring dashboards to observe system health and performance.

## 6. Document System Architecture and Usage [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation detailing the system architecture, data flow, and usage instructions for the calculation engine and data ingestion pipeline.
### Details:
Include diagrams of system components, explanations of data processing steps, and guidelines for maintenance and troubleshooting.
