# Description: Build the data entry interface with manual and CSV upload options
# Details:
Create app/data-entry/page.tsx with selection between manual entry and CSV upload. Build app/data-entry/manual/page.tsx integrating MetricsForm component with submission handling and success feedback. Create app/data-entry/csv/page.tsx with CSVUploader component, processing status, and batch results display. Implement proper navigation flow, form state management, and error handling throughout the data entry process.

# Test Strategy:
Test navigation between manual and CSV entry modes, verify form submissions work correctly, validate CSV processing shows proper progress and results, and ensure error states are handled gracefully.
