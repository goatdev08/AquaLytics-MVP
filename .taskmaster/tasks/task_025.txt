# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Comprehensive testing and validation of all MVP requirements
# Details:
Perform end-to-end testing of all user flows: swimmer creation, manual metric entry, CSV upload, data visualization, filtering, and analytics. Validate all acceptance criteria: performance benchmarks (< 2s load time, < 500ms processing), responsive design (320px-1920px), Phoenix theme consistency, data accuracy of automatic calculations. Test with real swimming data, verify database integrity, and ensure proper error handling throughout the application. Prepare deployment configuration and documentation.

Execute complete user journey testing, validate all acceptance criteria are met, perform cross-browser and device testing, verify data accuracy with manual calculations, and ensure application is ready for production deployment.
