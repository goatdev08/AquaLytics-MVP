# Task ID: 16
# Title: Create Chart.js Visualization Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Build interactive charts for metrics visualization using Chart.js with Phoenix theme
# Details:
Create components/charts/ directory with: MetricsChart.tsx (line chart for metric progression over time), ProgressChart.tsx (multi-line chart for swimmer progress comparison), ComparisonChart.tsx (radar chart for multi-metric swimmer comparison), RankingTable.tsx (sortable table with Phoenix styling). Configure Chart.js with Phoenix color scheme, responsive design, interactive tooltips, and export functionality. Implement lib/utils/chart-configs.ts with reusable chart configurations and Phoenix theme integration.

# Test Strategy:
Test charts render correctly with real data, verify responsive behavior on different screen sizes, validate interactive features (hover, click, zoom), and ensure Phoenix theme is applied consistently.
