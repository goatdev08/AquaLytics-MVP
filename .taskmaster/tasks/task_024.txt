# Task ID: 24
# Title: Add Error Handling and Loading States
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback systems
# Details:
Create error boundary components for graceful error handling, implement toast notifications for user feedback, add loading spinners and skeletons for all async operations. Build error pages (404, 500) with Phoenix theme. Implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls, offline state detection, and proper error logging. Create user-friendly error messages and recovery suggestions.

# Test Strategy:
Test error boundaries catch and display errors properly, verify loading states show during all async operations, validate error messages are user-friendly and actionable, and ensure retry mechanisms work correctly.
