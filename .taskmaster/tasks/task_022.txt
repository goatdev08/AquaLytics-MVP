# Task ID: 22
# Title: Add Custom React Hooks for Data Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create custom hooks for efficient data fetching and state management
# Details:
Build lib/hooks/useSwimmers.ts with swimmer CRUD operations, caching, and optimistic updates. Create lib/hooks/useMetrics.ts for metrics data fetching with filtering and pagination. Build lib/hooks/useChartData.ts for chart data transformation and caching. Implement lib/hooks/useFilters.ts for filter state management and URL synchronization. Add proper error handling, loading states, and TypeScript typing to all hooks.

# Test Strategy:
Test hooks handle loading and error states correctly, verify caching reduces unnecessary API calls, validate optimistic updates work with proper rollback, and ensure hooks are properly typed and reusable.
