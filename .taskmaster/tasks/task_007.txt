# Description: Build the main application layout with header, sidebar, and navigation components
# Details:
Create app/layout.tsx as root layout with Phoenix theme provider, dark mode toggle, and responsive structure. Build components/layout/Header.tsx with navigation menu, app title with Phoenix gradient, user actions, and mobile hamburger menu. Create components/layout/Sidebar.tsx with collapsible navigation, filter panels, and responsive behavior. Implement components/layout/Footer.tsx with app info and links. Use Next.js App Router for navigation with proper loading states and error boundaries.

# Test Strategy:
Test navigation between all routes, verify responsive behavior on mobile/tablet/desktop, validate dark mode toggle works across all components, and ensure proper loading states during navigation.
