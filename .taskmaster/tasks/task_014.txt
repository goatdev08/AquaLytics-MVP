# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement CSV Upload and Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Create CSV file upload functionality with validation and batch processing
# Details:
Build components/data/CSVUploader.tsx with drag-and-drop interface, file validation (CSV format, size limits), and preview functionality. Create app/api/upload-csv/route.ts as proxy to Python serverless function. Implement api/utils/csv_processor.py with pandas for CSV parsing, data validation, and batch insertion. Support CSV format: fecha,nadador,competencia,distancia,estilo,fase,t15_1,brz_1,t25_1,f1,t15_2,brz_2,t25_2,f2,t_total,brz_total. Include progress tracking, error reporting, and rollback on validation failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test CSV upload with valid and invalid files, verify batch processing handles large datasets, validate error reporting shows specific row/column issues, and ensure rollback works on failures.
